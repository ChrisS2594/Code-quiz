# Code-quiz
My intention with this project was to create a reactive quiz with javascript that wrote content to the page. 

I first started by building the HTML file to give it a general layout.

Secondly I wrote the css file and copied a small css profile from a directory.

From there I wrote through javascript.js to set the timer, however I could not get the timer to function.

finally I wronte th questions and answers in a seperate JS file.

Lastly I started this READEme file to explain the content of the assignment.
